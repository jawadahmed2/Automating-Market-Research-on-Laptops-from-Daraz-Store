# Automating-Market-Research-on-Laptops-from-Daraz-Store
Python Internship  Project At Codeaza  Technologies

## Problem Statement: Automating Market Research on Laptops from Daraz Store
- Background: Our client, a seller on the popular e-commerce platform Daraz, is looking to gather
market research data on laptops available in the store. They want to automate the process of
scraping data from the “laptop” category on Daraz and store it in a database for further analysis.
Additionally, the client wishes to schedule this automation to run every Tuesday. To ensure smooth
operation and troubleshooting, they also require comprehensive documentation and integrated logs
functionality.
- Objective: The main objective of this project is to develop a Selenium bot that automates the data
scraping process from the laptop category on Daraz. The bot should extract relevant information
about laptops, such as product details, prices, ratings, and customer reviews, and store it in a
database. The automation should be scheduled to run every Tuesday to ensure regular updates on
the latest laptop offerings.
- Requirements:
- 1. Selenium Bot: Develop a Selenium-based bot that can navigate the Daraz website, scrape
data from the laptop category, and extract essential information about each laptop listing.
- 2. Database Integration: Implement a database system to store the scraped data efficiently. The
database should support the required fields, such as product name, price, ratings, reviews,
and other relevant attributes.
- 3. Scheduling: Configure the bot to run automatically every Tuesday, ensuring that the data
scraping process is executed at regular intervals. The scheduling mechanism should handle
any necessary authentication steps and initiate the scraping process seamlessly.
- 4. Documentation: Prepare comprehensive documentation that outlines the functionality and
usage of the Selenium bot. The documentation should include installation instructions,
configuration details, step-by-step guides, and examples to help users understand and utilize
the bot effectively.
- 5. Logging Integration: Integrate logging functionality into the Selenium bot to track its
execution and record any errors, exceptions, or successful cases. The logs should provide
valuable insights for troubleshooting and enhancing the bot's performance.

- Conclusion: By developing a Selenium bot to automate the scraping of laptop data from the Daraz
store, storing it in a database, scheduling the automation, and incorporating logging capabilities, our
client will be able to gather valuable market research on laptops. The automation will save time and
effort, allowing the client to focus on analyzing the data and making informed decisions to optimize
their laptop-selling strategy on Daraz.
